# Discogs-Scrapper-BS
My attempt to create scrapper for discogs using BeautyfullSoap Python library that turned out to be not so good idea in the end. Discogs start to drop connection attempts after while, so there is must be pause before next connection attempt. So this makes script really slow, and probably have no practical use(thats why in this example only first page getting scrapped and original plan was scrapping all possible pages/items). So this is more example of BeautifulSoup application then something what can be used for real tasks.
